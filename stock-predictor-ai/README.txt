# Project Overview
This project explores predictive modeling for stock trends using:
- Historical stock price data
- Time series forecasting techniques
- Sentiment analysis from external sources (planned)

The goal is to build a robust and modular pipeline for **quantitative analysis**, usable by **hedge funds or financial analysts** seeking predictive insights.

---

# Features and Techniques
- Data collection and cleaning (pipeline completed)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA completed)
- Linear Regression and Random Forest (in progress)
- LSTM time series modeling (planned)
- Sentiment integration from news or social media (planned)

---

# Folder Structure


---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebooks, Virtual Studio Code
- TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM  
- VADER/TextBlob for sentiment analysis

---

## How to Run 
Documentation for running the project will be added after the modeling stage is completed.

---

## Contact
Feel free to reach me via (nishanthpersonal12@gmail.com) for questions or collaboration. I prefer written communications over voice/video.

---

## Note
This is a work-in-progress project. The README and codebase will be continuously updated as new models are implemented and tested.
