Next Steps (Logically Ordered):
1. Data Preparation for Modeling
Merge or align all cleaned stock datasets

Format the "Date" column correctly as index if needed

Handle missing dates or forward-fill if required

Normalize or scale prices (if required for your model)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plot stock trends for understanding patterns

Check volatility, average returns, volume spikes

Use correlation matrix to find related stocks

This step is not just academic — it helps you:

✔ Know what features to engineer
✔ Spot anomalies early

3. Modeling: Predict Future Prices
Since you're starting with regression, you'd:

Decide your target: e.g., next day's closing price

Decide your features: e.g., previous N days' prices, volume

Choose model:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression (easy, robust)

Later: LSTM, Monte Carlo, etc.

4. Training + Evaluation
Split data: train/test

Fit model on train

Evaluate with:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Visualization: predicted vs. actual

5. Visualization of Predictions
Plot actual vs predicted

Optionally save plots in /results/ folder

6. (Optional but Valuable) Add Sentiment Analysis
Scrape or load tweets/news/headlines

Analyze sentiment using:

VADER (fast, works for social media)

TextBlob or HuggingFace transformers

Merge sentiment score as an extra feature

7. Build Minimal User Interface
You said you'll do this later, so maybe:

A script or notebook for now

Later: Streamlit or Flask web app
