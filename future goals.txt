Points to remember:
1. if businesses think they are in control then I should be the one who decides who needs to be in control.
2. AI has the smarts and is simply an extension of the human mind, you use only 1% of your mind power and the rest is AI.
3. ELIMINATING THE HIGH RECURRING COSTS OF HUMAN QUANTS WITH A POWERFUL, AI-DRIVEN SUBSCRIPTION MODELâ€”BRINGING SCALABLE, AUTOMATED QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS TO BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE.
