This experimental project of stock prediction by analyzing already existing historical stocks/markers. We will be using several prediction models aimed at further in-depth prediction using concepts like linear regression, time series concepts, Sentiment Analysis combining complex models into one entire package to improve prediction analysis. 

In this project, we are dedicated to finding solutions and the hidden meaning behind every stock so far we have collected. They may involve the usage of exploratory data analysis or data pipelining to clean stock markers and process them further for data analysis. So far at the time of writing this i have completed both the processes of EDA and data pipelining and am not entitled to comment of topics like regression or LSTM. But so far i have been learning all topics regarding these models and i put my maximum effort trying to understand concepts like these. 

This project is mostly targeted for quantitative analysts or companies like the hedge funds that mostly are involved in the trade of stock marketing. I do not really enjoy writing README files or documentation because I feel like I am very invested into learning, structuring and organizing than i enjoy writing these. I do not know if this really satisfy your curious mind about what am really doing, its best i an contacted personally. I mostly prefer talking through emails or texts than interpersonal communications.
